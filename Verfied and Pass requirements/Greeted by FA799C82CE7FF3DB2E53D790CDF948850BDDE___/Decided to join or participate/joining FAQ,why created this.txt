Well cyberbullying is a valid term before this is created.
The short background story is that it is all known,but no one actually takes action.
All imaginary verbal support.Is that useful?
Well logically it will probably work if it is small forum bullying.But when it scales.
It scales well,with technology improves day by day.
Just like the weapon we have.It is not the same as the weapons we have few hundred years ago.
The network we have is internet,inside have systems in it.I think I shall stop at here.
