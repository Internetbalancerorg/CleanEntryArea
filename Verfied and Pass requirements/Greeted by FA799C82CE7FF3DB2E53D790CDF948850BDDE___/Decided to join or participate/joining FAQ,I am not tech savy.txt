Sure,it is ok.
However,you also gotta put in some effort to setup something.

1)Know what is hashing,In short it is used to create a good unique id.
It is also one of essence in digital security and privacy.

2)Know how to know the difference between online identity and physical identity.
all harm comes from binding physical body to the digital entity.
Insult i suppose is ok with you but a real life physical death threat I can assume is a no for you.
So,know this well.

3)ask for help if have problems.
The power of so called viral is just like virus,it exist in internet,good or bad virus is another story.
Just like online games,10 entity in a short time is also not hard if the community is big and have a specific aim.
