The International Sanitary Conferences, originally held on 23 June 1851, were the first predecessors of the WHO. 
A series of 14 conferences that lasted from 1851 to 1938, the International Sanitary Conferences worked to combat many diseases,
chief among them cholera, yellow fever, and the bubonic plague. The conferences were largely ineffective until the seventh, in 1892;
when an International Sanitary Convention that dealt with cholera was passed.
