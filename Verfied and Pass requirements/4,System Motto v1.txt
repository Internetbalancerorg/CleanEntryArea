The System Motto v1.Like propaganda or aim...whatever you call it.
However,it is Close to ABSOLUTE. and not some abstract one line motto some profitable company uses.

1)Create and preserve fair and clean internet.
Fair,yes the fair that is similar to definition in physical world law.
But,We are going to execute it with great thinking ability and not based on few single entity arguing and deciding.
The discussions is always clear and logical and can be verified,most public infos will be shown,anyone that pass the requirements can participate.

2)No inherited Game Master mechanics.
This system is not controlled by other higher entity,no god above god concept.No poker god concept.
Those who create chaos will be destroy or remove from the sanctuary.

3)No passing something under the table,it will only happen when something goes very wrong or very serious.
Clear fair and powerful internal operation,and will go stealth if and only if needed.

4)Does not care or obey the rule of someone have some physical tradeable thing more will confirm win.
Financial flow or status should be as clear as situation allows,have logical flow and fair.
As trading is a easy to understand concept and one of tools embedded in humanity since ancient times.
any questionable discussion or external judge is of that single entity logical thinking problem.

5)Promotes using some brain power if available instead of luck or guide from some unknown flow
Decisions and solutions are generally a output from a huge info and solved with many units of brain power
Unlike some happy go luck or instinct driven system.
Which has created chaos since ancient times until after certain,World War then humans have become more intellect.
But,still have many inherited complex problems and created more problems in the meantime.
